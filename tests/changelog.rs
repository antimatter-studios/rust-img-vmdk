//! The changelog's shape and its agreement with `Cargo.toml`, checked rather
//! than remembered.
//!
//! rust-img-vhdx#63 is the defect this exists for, and it was found by a review bot rather
//! than by anything here: `Header` gained a required public field after
//! v0.3.5 and `pub fn encode_header(h: &Header)` makes that reachable — a
//! downstream has no way to build a `Header` except by struct literal, which
//! no longer compiled. The pending release was on course to be a patch.
//!
//! The issue notes the same shape was found independently in two sibling
//! repositories in the same month: `rust-partitions` (`Partition` gained two
//! fields at 0.4.1, the changelog recording one of them) and `rust-fs-ext4`
//! (`XattrEntry` gained a field and `Error` a variant, at 0.5.1, with
//! `[Unreleased]` empty). Three repositories, same mistake. The issue asks
//! for a release-checklist item; this is the same idea written as something
//! that runs, because a checklist nobody reads is a residue and the bot's
//! five accurate reports on the sibling did not enforce its own convention
//! either.
//!
//! WHAT A TEST CAN AND CANNOT SEE. It cannot tell whether a change to `src/`
//! broke an API — that needs the previous release's rustdoc to compare
//! against. It can insist the changelog **says so in a place the release
//! reads**: an entry marked `BREAKING` in a released section means the minor
//! moved. That turns "remember semver at release time" into a failure with a
//! line number, and leaves the judgement — is this breaking? — where it has
//! to be, with the person writing the entry.
