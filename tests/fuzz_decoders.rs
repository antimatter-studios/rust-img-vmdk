//! The stable-toolchain half of the fuzzing setup: replay the corpus,
//! then mutate it, and refuse if a decoder panics, hangs, or if the
//! suite quietly stopped doing any work.
//!
//! # Why there are two halves
//!
//! `fuzz/` holds `cargo-fuzz` targets. Those are the explorer: they run
//! for as long as you give them and find inputs nobody thought of. They
//! cannot be a required check, because how long they ran decides what
//! they found, and a fresh discovery would fail whichever unrelated
//! pull request happened to be open.
//!
//! This suite is the gate. Deterministic, on the stable toolchain, in
//! every pull request, reading the same `fuzz/corpus/` the explorer
//! does. Anything the explorer finds is committed there and replayed
//! here from then on.
//!
//! # Why there are two kinds of parser here
//!
//! VMDK is two parsers, not one, and they fail differently. The binary
//! sparse header carries `grain_size`, `num_gtes_per_gt`, `gd_offset`
//! and `capacity`, all used in arithmetic on the read path -- a grain
//! size that multiplied out to zero and divided by zero on the first
//! read was a real finding in this family on 2026-09-06. The descriptor
//! is TEXT: unbounded line lengths, extent lines whose declared sizes
//! need not match the file, and parent links.
//!
//! So the corpus holds two images `qemu-img` wrote -- a
//! monolithicSparse and a streamOptimized, which are different files
//! rather than a flag -- plus the header sector and the descriptor text
//! cut out of each.
//!
//! The descriptor target uses `from_utf8`, not a lossy conversion,
//! because that is what the read path does: a descriptor that is not
//! UTF-8 is refused there, so mutating one into a lossily-repaired
//! string would test a path no image can reach.
//!
//! # The corpus is an oracle
//!
//! `qemu-img` wrote `A` at offset 0 and `B` at 500,000, with a hole
//! between them. `the_corpus_reads_back_what_qemu_img_wrote` checks
//! that this crate returns exactly that, so the reference
//! implementation is the standard on every pull request -- on a machine
//! with no `qemu-img` installed.
