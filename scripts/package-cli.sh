# Package the built command-line tool as a release tarball in the current
# directory, check it, and print its file name on stdout.

#   <label>     the platform: darwin-arm64 or linux-x86_64
#   [bin-dir]   where the built `rust-img-vmdk` is (default: target/release)
#
# THE TARBALL IS THE CONTRACT with whatever installs it, and every
# repository in the family uses one layout: an install prefix, copied as-is,
# so an installer needs to know nothing about which tools are in it.
#
#   bin/rust-img-vmdk                             the multi-call binary
#   bin/img.vmdk -> rust-img-vmdk                  a relative symlink per name
#   share/man/man1/<name>.1, <name>-<verb>.1     generated man pages
#   share/zsh/site-functions/_<name>             generated completions
#   share/bash-completion/completions/<name>
#   share/fish/vendor_completions.d/<name>.fish
#   share/rust-img-vmdk/CAVEATS                   at most four lines

#
# Cargo refuses a dot in a target name, so THE DOTTED NAMES ARE MADE HERE,
# as symlinks. The man pages and completions come from the binary itself
# (`rust-img-vmdk generate ...`), from the argument definitions it parses
# with, so they cannot describe a flag it does not take.
#
# THEN IT CHECKS WHAT IT BUILT, from the unpacked tarball: exactly the
# members above; each dotted name a relative symlink to the binary; a man
# page and three completions for every name; CAVEATS at most four lines;
# and every name answering --help, and --version as `<name> (<crate>)
# <version>`, which identifies it among same-named programs and catches a
# tag that disagrees with Cargo.toml. The names are written here, not read
# from the binary: a binary that forgot one would otherwise agree with
# itself. On any failure nothing is printed on stdout and no tarball is
# left. tests/scripts/test-package-cli.sh holds this script to all of that.
