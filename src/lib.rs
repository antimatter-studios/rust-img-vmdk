//! Pure-Rust VMDK (VMware Virtual Machine Disk) reader.
//!
//! Currently handles the **monolithic sparse** variant — by far the
//! most common shape: a single `.vmdk` file containing a sparse-extent
//! header, an embedded text descriptor, the grain directory, the grain
//! tables, and the grain data. Other variants (monolithicFlat split
//! across files, twoGbMaxExtent, streamOptimized, vmfs) are reported
//! as [`Error::Unsupported`] so callers can surface a clear message
//! rather than reading garbage.
//!
//! Implements [`fs_core::BlockRead`] and [`fs_core::BlockDevice`] so the
//! reader plugs straight into the partition probe + filesystem driver
//! stack.

// hangs off one `mod` line, and losing that line leaves the file present,
// uncompiled, and asserting nothing, with no lint to say so. Inline,
// there is no declaration to lose. It cannot live in `tests/` at all --
// it has to be part of the library target that the debug step builds,
// because the question it answers is about that build.
