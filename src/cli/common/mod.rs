//! The command-line plumbing every driver's tools share: dispatch on
//! `argv[0]`, `--version`, `doctor`, the JSON output and the structured
//! error, and the `--json`/`--text` switch.
//!
//! IT KNOWS NOTHING ABOUT VMDK, and must not learn. A driver describes
//! itself once, as a [`Family`] — the repository name, the crate and
//! version, the install hints, and one [`Tool`] per dotted name, each a
//! clap command and a function that runs it — and hands that to
//! [`main`]. Everything here reads only that description. That is what
//! lets this directory be lifted, as it stands, into a crate the other
//! drivers depend on: nothing in it names a format, and nothing
//! outside it is reached from it.
//!
//! THE CONTRACT IT CARRIES, so each driver fills it in rather than
//! defining its own:
//!
//! - **One binary, many names.** Invoked as a tool's dotted name
//!   (`img.vmdk`), it is that tool. Invoked under any other name — the
//!   repository's (`rust-img-vmdk`), or a renamed copy — the first
//!   argument names the tool, by its verb (`img`) or its full name
//!   (`img.vmdk`). That second form is the one nothing on PATH can
//!   shadow.
//! - **`--version`** prints `<tool> (<crate>) <version>` for every name,
//!   which is how `doctor` and the test suites tell our binary from
//!   another package's program of the same name.
//! - **Output.** A result is JSON on stdout by default, `--text` for
//!   people; file content is raw bytes and is never wrapped. A failure is
//!   `{"error": "...", "code": N}` on STDERR, and `N` is the exit status,
//!   so stdout carries a result or nothing — never half of one, and never
//!   an error a pipe would take for data.
//! - **Exit statuses**, outside a tool that has its own scheme (`fsck`'s
//!   0/1/4/8): 0 done, 1 failed, 2 the command line was wrong, 3 the verb
//!   exists but this driver cannot do it (not implemented, or the format
//!   is read-only). A script moved between filesystems fails loudly on 3
//!   instead of meaning something else.
//! - **`<repo> doctor`** resolves every dotted name on PATH and says, per
//!   name, whether the program found is ours, and if not, what wins and
//!   how to fix it.
